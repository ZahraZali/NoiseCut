NoiseCut is a Python package for denoising seismic records and specializes in denoising Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) data. It effectively separates long-lasting narrowband signals from broadband transients using harmonic-percussive separation algorithms (Zali et al., 2021 & Zali et al., 2023). The advantage of NoiseCut is that it preserves the earthquake signal with its entire frequency and amplitude after denoising.

## Usage example
After installing the package to denoise a signal, you can use the following code. Outputs are the denoised signal and a figure showing the spectrogram of the input signal, the separated noise, and the denoised signal in the frequency range of [0-1] Hz.

import noisecut                                                                                                                                                         
import obspy

```
st = obspy.read('file_name')
hps_trace, spectrograms = noisecut.noisecut(st[0], ret_spectrograms=True)
noisecut.plot_noisecut_spectrograms(*spectrograms)
```
